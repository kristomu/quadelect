These are interpreters of user-provided ballots. Currently we handle the simple
	"1: A > B = C" format.

The classes return a pair of a int-to-string map (mapping candidate numbers to
names) and a ballot group (consisting of the ballots themselves). Compression
and other postprocessing has to be done outside the class in question.
