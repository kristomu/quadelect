This directory contains programs that are meant to show results about
multiwinner methods. They are not part of an ordinary quadelect build.

Current programs:

- normal\_integral.cc: Determines the optimal winner locations for Harmonic
voting for a one-dimensional standard normal spatial model with infinite
voters and candidates. This shows that delta = 0.5 does not give the (perhaps)
intuitively proportional result of the optimum winners being at the 25th and
75th percentiles of the normal.
