These files are for reference: they're my implementations of CPO-STV and
Forest Simmon's "Condorcet-Flavored PR Method" (http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2002-October/106819.html,
more specifically the Borda version: http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2002-November/106942.html).

This code is from 2005 and I don't expect it to be all that great.
