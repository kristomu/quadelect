This directory contains code for constructing convex polytopes that model
constrained elections (e.g. pairs where the second election is the result of
raising some candidate in the first election). They are used for more quickly
generating monotonicity and cloning tests than standard rejection sampling
can accomplish.

Some of the code here is a copy of my convex_magic repo. We'll see if they'll
go out of sync or I can keep mind enough to copy all changes back as they
happen (except for those changes that have been made to adapt the code to
quadelect in general, such as using quadelect's RNG instead of the standard
C++ RNG).
