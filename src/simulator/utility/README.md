This directory contains code pertaining to utilitarian calculations. Currently
two utilitarian efficiency types are supported:

	- vse.cc: VSE/SUE (social utility efficiency), the mean utility of the candidates elected by a method under a given model, with the scale normalized so optimum is mapped to a value of one and election randomly is mapped to a value of zero.

	- opt_hitrate.cc: Optimal hit rate, the probability that the method elects the candidate with highest utility. Used in Armytage2016.
