Code for handling the different modes of operation will go here:
	- Yee diagram drawing (ideally multiprocess)
	- Kendall-tau distance calculations, virtual coordinate
	- Criterion testing
	- Bayesian regret (ideally proportionality too for multiwinner,
		and graphing using interface into gnuplot).
	- JGA-type strategic vulnerability testing. (Should also ask
		JGA if he can give me the code for Gaussian so we can find
		out why his Gaussian/spatial models give so different results
		from mine.)
	- Determining the winner based on input ballots. I still use CElect for
		this, heh. Similarly, determining the winner given a Condorcet
		matrix.
