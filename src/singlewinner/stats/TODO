TODO (BLUESKY?): Split into a rated-scores array that supports normalization of
various sorts (no norm; norm between min, max; norm with std. dev, whatnot). 
Then each of the statistical methods (cardinal, etc.) takes those as input. 
Continuous cumulative voting is just CR with power of each ballot held constant,
for instance.

Doing so would make IRNR quite easy to do. (Well, that and handling hopefuls
sensibly, somehow.)
