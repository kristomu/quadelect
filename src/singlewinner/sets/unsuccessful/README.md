This directory contains set ideas that were ultimately unsuccessful at
advancing the state of the art. These are intended to reproduce the lack
of success and possibly for further experimentation.

Currently we have:

## Resistant winner set
An analog of the resistant set, but A is the sole member if A directly
disqualifies everybody else, otherwise the set is the set of all candidates.
This is clearly monotone, but it failed to capture the resistant set's
strategy resistance.
