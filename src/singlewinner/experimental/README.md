These methods are all experimental and so may not be any good or even be
defined for more than three candidates. They're being used to determine what
makes a method strategy resistant, and if it's possible to engineer a method
that's considerably more strategy resistant than the usual "advanced" methods
(Schulze, etc) while also passing Condorcet and being defined for large numbers
of candidates.

To signal that they're all experimental, all of these methods have names
that start with EXP.
