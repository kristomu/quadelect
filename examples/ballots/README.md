This directory contains example elections. Currently we have:

- Burlington2009.txt - The Burlington, 2009 election where IRV elects Kiss but Montroll is the Condorcet winner
- EjlakMethodX.txt - Filip Ejlak's tie example for IFPP Method X. The outcome is B = C = D > A, but it's possible to raise B in such a way that he no longer wins, showing the need for an appropriate tiebreaker.
- EjlakMethodX_after.txt - The tie example after raising B.
