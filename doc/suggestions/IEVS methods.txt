Which of the IEVS methods do we support? (Quadelect, Quadcache supports less)

		support (# = yes, ? = kinda, ?? = unsure)
Socially Best	?
Socially Worst	?
Random Winner	#
Plurality	#
Borda		#
IRV		#
Approval
Range		#
Smith set	#
Schwartz set	#
Antiplurality	#
Top 2 runoff		(To implement this, we'll need a concept of honesty
			 vs. strategy. Otherwise, it's just the contingent
			 vote.)
Condorcet LR	#
Simpson-Kramer	#
Bucklin		?
Copeland	#
SimmonsCond		("First preference Copeland", requires Plur and Cond.)
Smith,IRV	#	(But do fix the bugs in comma.)
BTR-IRV		#	(STV-ME)
DMC			(Smith,Approval)
			(But we could also have "that's in a cycle" version...
			 while there is a cycle, eliminate the weakest whatever
			 in the cycle.)
Dabagh		#	(2 * top ranks + 1 * second rank, positional)
VtForAgainst	#
SchulzeBeatpath	#
PlurIR			(Contingent vote: requires Plur and Condorcet data)
Black			("Condorcet set", then Black = Condorcet,Borda)
RandomBallot	#	(Maybe also RandomVoterHierarchy)
			(RB winner could be done positionally, roulette among 
			 1st pref, but must then be FRACTIONAL and can't give
			 info about further preferences, so call that "Random
			 Positional" instead.)
RandomPair	#	(Both utility and rank?)
NansonBaldwin	#	(should perhaps make summable version)
Nauru		#
TopMedianRating	#	(OH YEAH.)
LoMedianRank		(Should be possible to synthesize from the one above)
RaynaudElim	??	(Loser-Elimination/Minmax?)
ArrowRaynaud	??	(Loser-Elimination/Maximin?)
Sinkhorn	#
KeenerEig	#
MDDA			(MD/A or MD,A)
VenzkeDisqPlur
CondorcetApprov		( C//A or C,A)
Uncovered set	#
BramsSanverPrAV
Coombs		#
Top3IRV			(Make force_truncate(int depth) in ballot_tools, then
			 interface method. Permit "Top 3 Borda", etc. For
			 force_truncate, beware of ties - should truncate after
			 third rank, not third *entry*.)
ContinCumul
IterCopeland		(Could add as an INFINITY thing for nth order Copeland?)

HeitzigDFC
ArmytagePCSChul		(Cardinal Pairwise / Schulze)
Hay			(Perhaps a sqrt-range method and then "Roulette(X)"
			 generic method for randomly picking with prob 
			 proportional to rating? Generalization to multiple 
			 cands: pick winner, eliminate, pick 2nd place, etc.)
