Hi,

a fourth method of measuring the strength of pairwise wins in Condorcet
would be a statistical test called Binomial test.
See: http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/binomial.htm
Excel calculations at: http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/statexactbin.html

Short explanation:
Each vote for candidate A is coded as 1 and a vote for B is coded sa 0
n is the number of voters, who are not indifferent between A and B.
The hypothesed (H0) value of the mean is 0.5.
We compare the proportion of votes for A against the hypothesized mean 0.5
and calculate the probability that this prortion of votes for A is 0.5 (we
can use single or two tail tests, it doesn't matter, as the distribution is
symmetric).
The lower the probability that the proportion is 0.5, the bigger the
strength of the win for A.
Thus the rule to eliminate the weakest undropped link in point 3 at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method#The_Schwartz_set_heuristic will
amount to dropping the win, with the highest p-value (i.e. the win with the
highest probability that, for an infinite number of voters from the same
distribution as the current voters, the proportion of voters for candidate =
A
is 0.5).

I would prefer this method before proportional completion (let's call it
Schulze Condorcet (binomial test), at least as an initial hunch.
This method would give a penalty to wins with many indifferent voters due t=
o
few observations, which proportional completion does not.

I have no idea of what criterias
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method#Comparison_with_other_preferen=
tial_single-winner_election_methods>will
be satisfied or failed.

Best regards
Peter Zborn=C3=ADk
